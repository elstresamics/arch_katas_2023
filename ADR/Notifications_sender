# Notifications sender to handle several notification channels

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context and Problem Statement

The "Wildlife Watcher" system should allow sending notifications to...

The system should support sending messages via various communications channels, e.g., SMS, push notifications, emails, recorded messages, etc.

### Requirements

* Support for push message, email, and/or SMS notifications to ..., some immediate and some deferred and future possible channels and integrations.

### Assumptions

Several communication channels to communicate with ... should be supported.

## Decision drivers

* Several communication channels should be supported by the notifications service as plugins.
* New media channel addition should be supported as simply as possible by developing a new model and implementation of specific interfaces.

## Considered options

* Have the notifications sender engine be a microservice that communicates with other microservices dedicated to sending messages down specific channels.
* Make notifications sender a microkernel service that supports communication capability plugins.

## Decision

Make notifications sender a microkernel service that supports communication capability plugins.

__Reasons:__ 

* Easy to react to changes in plugin models while minimizing changes to the core system.
* Easy to deploy specific models rather than the whole system.
* Easy to test specific models as a component in isolation.

### Architectural style

__Microkernel__.

### Consequences

* Simple to maintain, deploy, and add plugins.
* Extensible.
* Should consider switching to microservices if the core system starts changing frequently.
